# Parking Management

**Parking management system** is used for managing the incoming and outgoing vehicles. This project is designed using simple C language. Here the user have to enter the details of the vehicle before parking it in the parking area, so that the amount of vehicles being parked in the slot can be monitored without getting any traffic involved in between. The users can even check for the availability of the area for parking their vehicle. This mini project is compiled using **Visual Studio Code** on Windows and Linux.
